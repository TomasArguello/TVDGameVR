# TVDGameVR
A Soft Interaction VR project, in collaboration with the Construction Science department of Texas A&amp;M University. A game that teaches construction science majors the importance of Target Value Delivery, or TVD.
This application simulates the TVD game played in various institutions around the country, where students must create a building out of common household items, such as coffee stirrers, spaghetti strands, wooden skewers, etc., in order to securely hold a marshmellow above a certain height. After the first building is successfully constructed, the students must rebuild the building with a new cost requirement. This new cost requirement will be the Target Value that the students must deliver to their customer. This application has online multiplayer functionality, which lets users work together no matter where they are.
